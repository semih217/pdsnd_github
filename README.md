### Credits
First of all I want to give credit to my Udacity Mentor Antonio Fortin, who was really patient with me
and encouraged me to proceed even when I was overwhelmed with all the new stuff.
Moreover, I have learned a lot of the material from the udacity plattform which stands out due to
the great quizes after each lesson.

Here are some more sources that I ve used for specific technical issues.
